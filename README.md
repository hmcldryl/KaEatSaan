# KaEatSaan - Where to Eat? 🍜

_Saan tayo kakain?_ No more "Bahala na si Batman"! Let KaEatSaan decide for you!

## About 🤔

KaEatSaan (a play on "Kahit Saan" or "Anywhere") is your trusty sidekick for those moments when you and your friends can't decide where to eat. Say goodbye to the endless "Kayo bahala" loop!

## Tech Stack 💻

This project has been rebooted with a new tech stack:

- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Hosting & DB:** [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
- **State Management:** [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)

The old Flutter version is now a thing of the past. I'm too lazy to document everything, so your best bet is to check out the code.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get a local copy up and running, it's pretty straightforward:

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Environments 🌐

We have two environments fully set up:

- **Production:** [kaeatsaan.web.app](https://kaeatsaan.web.app)
- **Development:** [dev-kaeatsaan.web.app](https://dev-kaeatsaan.web.app)

Each environment has its own hosting and database configuration.

## Testing 🧪

Do we have unit tests? Nope. I just test whatever locally before pushing. It is what it is.
