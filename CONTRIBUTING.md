# Contributing to KaEatSaan

First off, thanks for being interested in helping out! I'm not super strict about the whole process, so don't worry about it too much. The main goal is to have fun and make this app better.

## Getting Started

### For External Contributors (Fork Workflow)

1. **Fork the repository** - Click the "Fork" button on GitHub to create your own copy
2. **Clone your fork** - `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/KaEatSaan.git`
3. **Add upstream remote** - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/hmcldryl/KaEatSaan.git`
4. **Create a branch** - `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
5. **Make your changes and commit**
6. **Push to your fork** - `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
7. **Open a Pull Request** - From your fork to the `develop` branch of the main repo

### For Collaborators (Direct Access)

If you have collaborator access, you can create branches directly on the repo.

## The Super Simple Workflow

1.  **Branching:** Create a new branch for your feature or fix. I like to name them like this:
    - `feature/sample-feature`
    - `fix/bug-fix-name`

2.  **Commits:** I try to stick to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). It helps keep the history clean. A simple `feat: add new button` or `fix: correct a typo` is perfect.

3.  **Pull Requests (PRs):** When you're ready, open a Pull Request from your branch to the `develop` branch.

## PRs, Templates, and Labels
Honestly, I'm still too lazy to enforce strict templates and a bunch of labels. But there are some simple PR templates to help keep things a little organized. They're not required - just a guide to make PRs cleaner. Give your PR a clear title, fill in the template if you want, and that's good enough for me.
