# Contributing to KaEatSaan

First off, thanks for being interested in helping out! I'm not super strict about the whole process, so don't worry about it too much. The main goal is to have fun and make this app better.

## The Super Simple Workflow
I try to follow a basic Git workflow, but I won't get mad if you don't follow it to the letter.

1.  **Branching:** Create a new branch for your feature or fix. I like to name them like this:
    - `features/sample-feature`
    - `fixes/bug-fix-name`

2.  **Commits:** I try to stick to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). It helps keep the history clean. A simple `feat: add new button` or `fix: correct a typo` is perfect.

3.  **Pull Requests (PRs):** When you're ready, open a Pull Request from your branch to the `develop` branch.

## PRs, Templates, and Labels
Honestly, I'm too lazy to enforce strict templates and a bunch of labels. Just give your PR a clear title and a brief description of what you changed. That's good enough for me.
